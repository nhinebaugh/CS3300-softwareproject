# CS3300-softwareproject
This repo is a group project for CS3300. For this project we decided to create a small inventory management system that will have room to improve for future expansion. It will come with all of the basics needed to run a locally based inventory tracker for a small business.
It will use Tkinter for GUI interface and SQlite for database functionality.
